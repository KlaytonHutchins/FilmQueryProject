# FilmQueryProject

## Details
This program utilizes a database that contains films and actors (and lots of other data too). The program presents the user with a menu to
search through the database and find Actors or Films. The user can search by entering a number corresponding to the id of the actor or
film. They can also search with a string corresponding to a keyword of the film's title/description or to the first/last name of the actor
(partial hits to a name also work). When the query has been initiated, the program searches the database, instantiates actor and film
objects, and then prints the relevant information to the screen. If the user was searching for a film, they will also be given a second
menu to display more information about the film, or return to the main menu. The user is then prompted the original menu to choose again,
until he/she chooses to quit the program.

## What I Learned
During the process of making this program, I increased my understanding and experience with accessing a SQL database via Java code. I also
gained experience using Prepared Statements.

## Technologies Used
